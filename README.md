The aws account can be created from the link www.asw.amazon.com

There are two types of account Root Account and IAM Account

Root account is a special account by aws, and you should be aware that its like being a captain for a whole ship

Root account has features:
 - how to create IAM user
 - how to setup Root password
 - changin the support plan of aws
 - deleting the whole project

AWS tells to use the MFA for Root account

yCreating an IAM User Group: In the AWS console, navigate to IAM, and create a new user group. Name it appropriately (e.g., "admins") and attach the necessary permission policies.
Assigning Permissions: Use the Administrator Access policy for broad permissions or create custom policies for specific access needs, following the principle of least privilege.
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs): Each IAM user group and other AWS resources have a unique ARN, which helps in managing and linking resources within AWS.
